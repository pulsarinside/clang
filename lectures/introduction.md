# Introduction to C Programming

## What is C?

C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is one of the most influential and widely used programming languages in the world. C is known for its efficiency, simplicity, and close-to-hardware capabilities, making it the foundation for many modern programming languages and operating systems.

## Key Features of C

### 1. Simplicity and Efficiency

C was designed to be a simple yet powerful language. Its syntax is compact and expressive, allowing developers to write concise and efficient code.

### 2. Portability

C programs are highly portable, meaning they can run on various hardware platforms with minimal modifications. This portability is achieved through the use of a compiler, which translates C code into machine-specific binary code.

### 3. Low-Level and High-Level Capabilities

C offers both low-level programming features, such as direct memory manipulation, and high-level abstractions like functions and data structures. This versatility allows developers to write code that suits their needs.

### 4. Extensibility

C supports the creation of libraries and modules, making it easy to reuse code and extend the language's capabilities.

### 5. Close-to-Hardware

C provides direct access to memory addresses and system resources, making it ideal for systems programming, embedded systems, and writing operating systems.

## Hello World in C

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## In this program:

- #include <stdio.h> includes the standard input-output library, allowing us to use functions like printf.
- int main() is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.
- printf("Hello, World!\n"); prints the "Hello, World!" message to the console.
- return 0; indicates successful program execution to the operating system.

## Compiling and Running C Programs
To compile a C program, you typically use a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). Assuming you have GCC installed, you can compile the "Hello, World!" program with the following command:
```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello
```

Here, hello.c is your source code file, and -o hello specifies the output executable's name. After successful compilation, you can run the program using:

```bash
./hello
```
You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed on your terminal.

### Conclusion
C is a powerful and versatile programming language with a rich history. Learning C provides a strong foundation for understanding computer systems, programming concepts, and a gateway to various programming domains.
